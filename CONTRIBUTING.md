# Contributing to Request

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Request and its packages, which are hosted in the [Request Organization](https://github.com/request) on GitHub.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Submitting an Issue

1. Provide a small self **sufficient** code example to **reproduce** the issue.
2. You should **always** use fenced code blocks when submitting code examples or any other formatted output:
  <pre>
  ```js
  put your javascript code here
  ```

  ```
  put any other formatted output here,
  like for example the one returned from using request-debug
  ```
  </pre>

If the problem cannot be reliably reproduced, the issue will be marked as `Not enough info (see CONTRIBUTING.md)`.

If the problem is not related to request the issue will be marked as `Help (please use Stackoverflow)`.


## Submitting a Pull Request

1. In almost all of the cases your PR **needs tests**. Make sure you have any.
2. Run `npm test` locally. Fix any errors before pushing to GitHub.

## Becoming a Contributor

This is only a personal project for the [Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd1309/dashboard/overview)
so I'm not seriously expecting any contributions but I'm happy to accept
any decent PRs :stuck_out_tongue:


## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **Any** change should be added through Pull Request.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject
   to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other
   non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. For significant changes wait a full 24 hours before merging so that active
   contributors who are distributed throughout the world have a chance to weigh
   in.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.
1. Run `npm test` locally before submitting your PR, to catch any easy to miss
   style & testing issues.


## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.


## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be
subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have
something valuable to add or change.
